Aim: To make a python implementation of the card game, The Kenzo.

The basics of the kenzo:
52 cards total. A pyramid of cards is made, 7 cards on the bottom, decreasing to 1 at the top. The user then chooses a position on each row, if the card isn't a face card, advance to the next row and choose from the cards on that row. If the chosen card is a face card, restart from row 0 and replace all cards that have been overturned with cards from the deck. The player wins if they reach the top, and loses if they run out of cards to place over turned cards.

This project was mainly used to refresh my knowledge of basic OOP, before trying something harder and advancing my skills.
